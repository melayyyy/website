                <p>Migratory fish are species that travel long distances between habitats to complete critical life processes such as spawning, feeding, or escaping harsh environmental conditions. These fish display remarkable endurance and navigational abilities, often journeying across vast oceanic expanses or between freshwater and saltwater environments.

                    Examples include **salmon**, which migrate upstream from the ocean to spawn in freshwater rivers, and **eels**, which undertake the reverse journey, moving from freshwater to spawn in the ocean. Other migratory species, like **herring** and **tuna**, travel in large schools across seas in search of food or favorable breeding grounds.
                    
                    Migratory fish are vital to aquatic ecosystems, as their movements connect and sustain different habitats. They also support human economies through fishing industries. Their incredible journeys highlight their resilience and the intricate balance of nature that sustains them.</p>
