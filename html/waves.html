                <p>Wind waves are surface waves on water created when wind transfers energy to the water. Their size and behavior depend on factors like wind speed, duration, and the fetch (the distance wind travels over the water). Key features of wind waves include the crest (the highest point), trough (the lowest point), wavelength (the distance between crests), wave height (the vertical distance between crest and trough), and period (the time between consecutive crests).</p>
                <p>There are two main types: capillary waves, which are small ripples driven by surface tension, and gravity waves, which are larger and restored by gravity. Wind waves form when small ripples appear as wind begins to blow, grow as energy transfers to the water, and reach equilibrium in a fully developed sea. When the wind stops, the waves can travel long distances as smooth swells. These waves are significant for navigation, energy transfer, recreational activities like surfing, and supporting aquatic ecosystems by oxygenating water and distributing nutrients.</p>
