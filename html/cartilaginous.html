                <p>Cartilaginous fish, belonging to the class **Chondrichthyes**, are unique aquatic species with skeletons made entirely of cartilage instead of bone. This lightweight yet sturdy structure allows them to be agile and efficient swimmers. They are predominantly marine animals, thriving in oceans worldwide, with some species found in freshwater.  

                    Key examples include **sharks**, known for their streamlined bodies and role as apex predators; **rays and skates**, recognized for their flattened shapes and graceful movements; and **sawfish**, distinguished by their long, saw-like snouts. Cartilaginous fish lack swim bladders and rely on large, oil-rich livers to maintain buoyancy. Their tough, sandpaper-like skin is covered with tiny, tooth-like scales called dermal denticles, which reduce drag in the water.
