                <p>Freshwater fish inhabit rivers, lakes, ponds, and streams, thriving in environments with low salt concentrations. These fish are specially adapted to regulate water intake and salt balance in their bodies to survive in non-saline conditions. Found across a range of climates, freshwater species display remarkable diversity in size, shape, and behavior.  

                    Common freshwater fish include species like trout, bass, catfish, and tilapia, known for their ecological importance and value in aquaculture. Some, like koi and guppies, are celebrated for their vibrant colors and kept as ornamental fish in aquariums and ponds. Freshwater fish are vital to aquatic ecosystems, maintaining balance by feeding on plants, insects, or smaller aquatic organisms. Their adaptability and beauty make them a cornerstone of many natural and man-made freshwater habitats.</p>
